# Voxylon Litepaper  
**Version 1.0 — October 2025**

---

## Overview

**Voxylon (VXN)** is a community-owned, Ethereum-compatible Proof-of-Stake blockchain, launching with zero premine, no insiders, and no unfair advantages. Voxylon aims to be the fairest Layer 1 blockchain launch in crypto history, leveraging Ethereum's existing user base to bootstrap an entirely decentralized validator set at genesis.

---

## Vision

In a landscape dominated by premined tokens, VC-controlled chains, and centralized validator sets, Voxylon offers a radically fair alternative:

- No VCs or private sales  
- No team or founder allocation  
- No premined supply  
- 100% of the genesis validators are regular Ethereum users who’ve paid gas fees  
- The organizers retain zero control over the chain post-launch

---

## Consensus & Architecture

Voxylon is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain built as a clone of Ethereum's consensus and execution layer. It is EVM-compatible, and validators operate similarly to Ethereum's.

### Key Characteristics:

- EVM-Compatible — Easily migrate Ethereum apps and tooling.  
- 100 VXN per validator — Equal stake allocation at genesis.  
- Slashing & inactivity penalties — Adjusted to ensure chain finality during early phases.

## Eligibility & Registration

### Who Can Join?

Anyone who held an Ethereum account that paid at least 0.004 ETH in transaction fees (gas) by December 31, 2025 is eligible.

> At least 60 million accounts will qualify as validators.

### How to Register

1. Own an eligible Ethereum account.
2. Generate a 12 word seed and a validator public key via the [Key Generator](https://www.voxylon.com/keygen.html).
3. Sign and submit the validator key account data via the [Registration Portal](https://voxylon.com/register).

All registration data will be publicly auditable.

## Genesis Launch

- **Snapshot Date:** December 31, 2025  
- **Validator Registration Deadline:** December 31, 2025  
- **Final Validator List Published:** Early January 2026  
- **Genesis Launch:** **January 21, 2026**

Each valid participant will be included in the genesis state with a **100 VXN stake**. Voxylon will launch with tens of thousands to millions of independent validators.

In case of low initial validator participation, the chain will experience an **inactivity leak**, eventually recovering once enough validators get their stakes penalized. Launch parameters (e.g. inactivity penalty quotient) will be adjusted to ensure faster finalization during this phase.

## Fair Launch Philosophy

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Premine | ❌ None |
| Founders' Allocation | ❌ None |
| Airdrops | ❌ None |
| VC/Private Sale | ❌ None |
| Community Ownership | ✅ 100% |
| Open Validator Set | ✅ Yes |
| Public Tools & Audits | ✅ Yes |

Voxylon has no privileged parties — the **Nakamoto coefficient** at launch will likely be the highest in crypto.

---

## Technical Tools

All tooling will be open-source and available on GitHub: [https://github.com/voxylon](https://github.com/voxylon)

### Key Tools:

- ✅ **Validator eligibility checker** (BigQuery + CLI tool)  
- ✅ **Registration portal** (sign and submit validator data)  
- ✅ **Genesis builder** — deterministic and reproducible  
- ✅ **Validator setup guides** — for Prysm, Lighthouse, Nimbus, etc.  
- ✅ **Mainnet chain specs and configs**  
- ✅ **Audit scripts and validation logic**

---

## Community

The future of Voxylon depends entirely on its community. There is no central team, no controlling entity, and no external funding.

## Legal Notice

Voxylon is a community experiment and not an investment vehicle. It is not affiliated with the Ethereum Foundation. Participation in the validator set is voluntary and self-directed. Organizers provide no guarantees and retain no authority after launch.

---

## Final Thoughts

Voxylon is a bet on radical fairness. By bootstrapping a decentralized validator set using Ethereum’s existing ecosystem, Voxylon empowers users — not elites — to shape the future of a new chain.

Join us in creating the most fair launch in blockchain history.
