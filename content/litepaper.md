# 📄 Voxylon Litepaper  
**Version 1.0 — October 2025**

---

## ⚡ Overview

**Voxylon (VXN)** is a community-owned, Ethereum-compatible Proof-of-Stake blockchain, launching with **zero premine**, **no insiders**, and **no unfair advantages**. Voxylon aims to be the **fairest Layer 1 launch in crypto history**, leveraging Ethereum's existing user base to bootstrap an entirely decentralized validator set at genesis.

---

## 🌍 Vision

In a landscape dominated by premined tokens, VC-controlled chains, and centralized validator sets, Voxylon offers a radically fair alternative:

- No VCs or private sales  
- No team or founder allocation  
- No premined supply  
- 100% of the genesis validators are regular Ethereum users who’ve paid gas fees  
- The organizers retain **zero control** over the chain post-launch

Voxylon is not a product. It’s a protocol, launched by the community, for the community.

---

## ⚙️ Consensus & Architecture

Voxylon is a **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** blockchain built as a clone of Ethereum's consensus and execution layer. It is **EVM-compatible**, and validators operate similarly to Ethereum's.

### Key Characteristics:

- **EVM-Compatible** — Easily migrate Ethereum apps and tooling  
- **100 VXN per validator** — Equal stake allocation at genesis  
- **Slashing & inactivity penalties** — Adjusted to ensure chain finality during early phases  
- **No centralized checkpoints, no upgrade keys** — Fully decentralized governance from day one

---

## ✅ Eligibility & Registration

### Who Can Join?

Anyone who held an Ethereum account that paid at least **0.004 ETH in transaction fees** (gas) by **December 31, 2025** is eligible.

> Based on current projections, **60 million+ accounts** will qualify by the cutoff date.

### How to Register

1. **Own an eligible Ethereum account**  
2. Generate a **validator keypair** (Voxylon-compatible)  
3. Sign a message from your Ethereum account to prove ownership  
4. Submit both Ethereum and validator account data via the [registration portal](https://voxylon.net/register)

All registration data will be **publicly auditable**.

---

## 📦 Genesis Launch

- **Snapshot Date:** December 31, 2025  
- **Validator Registration Deadline:** December 31, 2025  
- **Final Validator List Published:** Early January 2026  
- **Genesis Launch:** **January 21, 2026**

Each valid participant will be included in the genesis state with a **100 VXN stake**, the minimum required to run a validator. Voxylon will launch with **tens of thousands to millions** of independent validators.

In case of low initial validator participation, the chain will experience an **inactivity leak**, eventually recovering once enough validators come online. Launch parameters (e.g. inactivity penalty quotient) will be adjusted to ensure faster finalization during this phase.

## 📊 Fair Launch Philosophy

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Premine | ❌ None |
| Founders' Allocation | ❌ None |
| Airdrops | ❌ None |
| VC/Private Sale | ❌ None |
| Community Ownership | ✅ 100% |
| Open Validator Set | ✅ Yes |
| Public Tools & Audits | ✅ Yes |

Voxylon has no privileged parties — the **Nakamoto coefficient** at launch will likely be **the highest in crypto**.

---

## 🛠 Technical Tools

All tooling will be **open-source** and available on GitHub: [https://github.com/voxylon](https://github.com/voxylon)

### Key Tools:

- ✅ **Validator eligibility checker** (BigQuery + CLI tool)  
- ✅ **Registration portal** (sign and submit validator data)  
- ✅ **Genesis builder** — deterministic and reproducible  
- ✅ **Validator setup guides** — for Prysm, Lighthouse, Nimbus, etc.  
- ✅ **Mainnet chain specs and configs**  
- ✅ **Audit scripts and validation logic**

---

## 🤝 Community

The future of Voxylon depends entirely on its community. There is no central team, no controlling entity, and no external funding. We are organizers — not owners.

## 📌 Legal Notice

Voxylon is a **community experiment** and **not an investment vehicle**. It is **not affiliated with the Ethereum Foundation**. Participation in the validator set is voluntary and self-directed. Organizers provide no guarantees and retain no authority after launch.

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Voxylon is a bet on **radical fairness** and **open participation**. By bootstrapping a decentralized validator set using Ethereum’s existing ecosystem, Voxylon empowers users — not elites — to shape the future of a new chain.

Join us in creating the most fair launch in blockchain history.

**Voxylon is not a project. It’s a protocol. You are the owner.**
